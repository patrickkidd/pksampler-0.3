	* MainWindow.py: renamed from PKSampler.py.
	
	* Grouping.py: Created to seperate the grouping classes from the 
	MainWindow.
	
	* Globals.py: Added DisplayTimer class, which calls updateDisplay() on 
	all rapidly-occuring display update functions,
	(eg. SampleWidget.MainDisplay.updateDisplay). This should reduce some 
	of the overhead cause by starting a gillion timers for each display 
	object, and provides a single point of control for all realtime
	displays.
	
	* ControlPanel.py: Update interval setting changes global DisplayTimer 
	interval, the change is therefore seen in real time.

	* install.py: Moved embedded_pixmaps.[py,pyc] to pksampler/pov, which
	is now manually copied from ./pksampler/pov to PKSAMPLERDIR/pksampler.
	This keeps eric from trying to parse the file every time a py file is 
	saved/opened.

	* PKSampler.py: added sample widget cacheing; loading samples is now
	nearly instantaneous.

	* pksampler: App seems to work _very_ well on this 1GHz Inspiron 8000, 
	with a maestro3 sound card. Maybe the bad sound on the pksampler dev 
	box is due to hardware problems?
