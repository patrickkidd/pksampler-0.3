for further instructions.


Known Issues:
-----------------------------------------

- There is an issue with reading pixmaps if some [Qt/KDE] icons styles are installed. Baghira is one example. This is an issue related to using embedded pixmaps with qembed/pyuic and some kind of funk performed by the style package. PKSampler works well with most default configurations.
